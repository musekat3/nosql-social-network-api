# User Story 
As a social media startup
I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
So that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. I also want to be able to test the databases data by using Insomnia to make sure that the database is processing correctly.

# Acceptance 
- Given the API 
- When I enter node server.js the server starts
- Once the server starts the database from MongoDB syncs
- When I open Insomnia
- I am then able to test the routes: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE with API routes USERS and THOUGHTS 
- Then I am able to successfully update the database
